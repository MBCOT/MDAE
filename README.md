# MDAE
**Minima Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem**

## MDAE would be the Advertising Ecosystem that was meant to be.

The goal of this project is a Minima Decentralized Advertising Ecosystem where
everyone can be fairly rewarded and where advertisers can very simply offer a new method
of rewards/advertising or even selling to their customers using tokens, smart contracts,
DApps and a DAO. A truly Minima Decentralized Advertising System designed as a DAO ruled
as it would be a nonprofit organization in order not to swap one monopoly from another.
DAO - The DAO mainly would manage the distribution of the Tokens.
Acts as a non-profit organization.
Its purpose is a novel one: act as an incubator for promising minima projects
and attract investors to it, reward the developers, improve the system over
future and support scientific projects on green energies.
